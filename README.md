# deluxetable

Implementation of deluxetable.sty, a LaTeX package that implements the 
aastex deluxetable environment. The deluxetable this implements is likely
older than, and therefor incompatible with in edge cases, deluxetable 
as implemented in aastex6.

This is based on deluxetable from the following URL:
http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/standard30/deluxetable.sty
with modifications to make it compatible with TeXLive-2016, as outlined
here:

I provide this software as is in the hopes that others might find it useful. I do not actually maintain or update it. In light of this, I'm setting this repo to archival mode.

# deluxetable

Implementation of deluxetable.sty, a LaTeX package that implements the 
aastex deluxetable environment. The deluxetable this implements is likely
older than, and therefor incompatible with in edge cases, deluxetable 
as implemented in aastex6.

This is based on deluxetable from the following URL:
http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/standard30/deluxetable.sty
with modifications to make it compatible with TeXLive-2016, as outlined
here:
